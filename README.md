yo_pid
======
Send yourself a YO when your work is done

Inspired by Yoman from Andrew Duberstein: http://www.andrewduberstein.com/item/2014/11/28/yoman/

Replace {api key} in the code with your own API key

usage a: "./yo_pid.sh -c '{COMMAND}' -u {YO_NAME}" to run a command and Yo when it is done

usage b: "./yo_pid.sh -p {PID} -u {YO_NAME}" to send an alert when the cpu time, memory percent, and processors in use stop changing. This is useful if you want to know when a process stops doing work, even if the PID is still active
